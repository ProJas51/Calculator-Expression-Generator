# Calculator-Expression-Generator
CALCULATOR RANDOM EXPRESSION GENERATOR: 

This program is created within a connection of HTML and Javascript. 

How to Run: 

	to incorporate mathjs to evaluate my expressions, I import mathjs from npm, which means that you should install npm inside
	of the file directory to allow the evaluations to work. 
	
	How to install npm: 
	
	1. open up terminal
	2. enter 'npm init' to initialize the npm module. 
	3. continue pressing enter until npm is fully initialized 
	
	Once the code is downloaded from the link provided to GitHub, load it into an IDE that supports html and JS (used Visual Studio Code to create), 
	and either open the testing.html file by double clicking on the file or opening the file
	with the live server extension in VScode. 
	
	The program will ask the user to input how many expresses do they want to be generated, and 
	then press the "GO" button to execute the expression generator. The generated expressions will 
	appear in console, as well as the evaluations for those expressions.
